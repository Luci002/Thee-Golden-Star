# Thee-Golden-Star
A 2D game coded in Java using swing components which will make a RPG game one day.  I am still very new to coding (months&lt;3 as of 6/11/18) so I wil slowly add more and more as I become more skilled. Also all art is custom and was made by me if you were wondering why the art was so bad lol...
